People create at their highest when they are focused, rested, and leave space for the creative process. But we also recognize that, within a collaborative organization, too much flexibility can lead to unstructured and isolated lives. In pursuit of our best work in a fulfilling, challenging work environment, we have set forth a few expectations.Working Days and Hours(Initial 90 day training period) Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm EST(Once training is complete) Full time Monday - Thursday, 9am - 5pm PSTFlexible Schedule 4 Day Work Week - We encourage everyone to view Friday (or whichever day becomes your flex day) as a day for personal growth, learning, travel, new experiences, extended fitness, and deep creative work. Anything that inspires and expands your experience, and may bring inspiration and growth to your daily work. No Meeting Mondays - Although everyone is expected to be available for other communications on Monday, there will be no scheduled meetings outside of department meetings or a company wide All Hands. All meetings and normal gatherings will be on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Monday is for creative flow time.  Distributed Work Locations - In addition to your home office, there will be open work spaces available in Dallas, NYC, and Miami. We believe this model can work effectively if everyone is as committed to their productivity, personal contribution, and the team’s performance as they are to their own flexibility. We intend to expand the business, our impact, and the financial freedom of everyone in it. We remain committed to advancing everyone’s personal careers and compensation as one of leadership’s primary responsibilities. We are very passionate about our culture.
